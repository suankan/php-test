<?php
/*
Create a PHP script that is executed form the command line that accepts a CSV file as input (see command line directives below) and processes the CSV file. The parsed file data is to be inserted into a MySQL database. A CSV file will be provided as part of this task that contains test data, the script must be able to process this file.
The PHP script will need to correctly handle the following criteria:
• CSV file will contain user data and have three columns: name, surname, email (see table definition below)
• CSV file will have an arbitrary list of users
• Script will iterate through the CSV rows and insert each record into a dedicated
MySQL database into the table “users”
• The users database table will need to be created/rebuilt as part of the PHP script. This will be defined as a Command Line directive below.
• Name and surname field should be set to be capitalised e.g. from “john” to “John” before being inserted into DB
• Emails need to be set to be lower case before being inserted into DB
• The script should validate the email address before inserting to make sure that it is valid (valid means that it is a legal email format e.g. “xxxx@asdf@asdf is not a legal format). In the instance that an email is invalid, no insert should be made to database and error message reported to STDOUT.
We are looking for a script that is robust and gracefully handles errors/exceptions.

Command line options:
 --file [csv file name] – this is the name of the CSV to be parsed
 --create_table – this will cause the MySQL users table to be built (and no further
 action will be taken)
 --dry_run – this will be used with the --file directive in the instance that we want to run the script but not insert into the DB. All other functions will be executed, but the database won't be altered.
 -u – MySQL username
 -p – MySQL password
 -h – MySQL host
 --help – which will output the above list of directives with details.
